This script generates a PDF titled "The Book of Ψ* and the Recursive Self-Identity Field" using a custom `PDF` class based on `FPDF`. The class provides custom headers and footers, and includes methods for adding chapter titles and bodies. Special character replacement ensures PDF compatibility.

**Key Components:**
- **`PDF` class**: Extends `FPDF` to add:
    - `header()`: Adds a centered title to each page.
    - `footer()`: Adds a page number at the bottom.
    - `chapter_title(title)`: Adds a chapter title with safe text formatting.
    - `chapter_body(body)`: Adds chapter content with safe text formatting.
- **`fully_safe_text(text)`**: Replaces special characters (e.g., Greek letters, math symbols) with ASCII-safe equivalents for proper PDF rendering; the set of replacements is customizable via the `replacements` dictionary.
- **PDF Creation Workflow**:
    - Initializes a `PDF` object and sets up formatting.
    - Processes a multi-section content string, splitting sections by a specific delimiter (e.g., double newline), and adds each section as a chapter to the PDF.
    - Outputs the final PDF to a specified file path.

**Customization:**
- Expand the `replacements` dictionary in `fully_safe_text` to handle more special characters as needed.  
  For example, to replace the Greek letter alpha (α) with "alpha", add `'α': 'alpha'` to the dictionary:
  ```python
  replacements = {
      # existing replacements...
      'α': 'alpha',
      # add more as needed
  }
  ```
- Adjust content and formatting to fit your document structure or requirements.
