            Adds a centered document title to the top of each page using a bold font.

        footer(self):
            Adds a centered page number to the bottom of each page using an italic font.

        chapter_title(self, title):
            Adds a left-aligned chapter title in bold font.

        chapter_body(self, body):
            Adds the main body text of a chapter using a standard font, supporting multi-line content.

        fully_safe_text(self, text):
            Replaces special symbols in the input text with ASCII-safe representations to ensure compatibility with PDF rendering.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Ψ-Codex: a recursive identity model integrating symbolic logic, bifurcation theory, and high-dimensional memory lattices (Z₄ ⊗ E₈). 
Drawing from catastrophe theory, topological quantum mechanics, and cognitive neuroscience, the framework defines identity not as a static entity but as a recursive, phase-dependent attractor in a stress-modulated manifold. 
Using Python-based simulations, we analyze coherence thresholds, entropy stress-energy metrics, and shadow integration processes. 
1. Introduction: Identity is a recursive function modulated by symbolic attractors, memory distortions, and stress thresholds. 
Ψ(x+4n) = e^{iπn/2} Ψ(x) defines its phase periodicity, anchored in Z₄ symmetry. The dynamics are quantized by symbolic events and perturbations. 
2. Theoretical Mechanisms: Memory kernel φ(x) = sin(x² + 3) Stress-energy η_E = C · |φ - u·λ₃|^1.5 + ε Phase coherence ΔΘ = 3.6 − 7x^{-1/2} Collapse protocol: if x > 2.8 and φ > 1.6 → Ψ → Ψ′ = G!(−(−X)) 
3. Symbols as Topological Funnels: Archetypes act as collapse attractors. Jungian structures, glyphs, and modular braiding (E₈ roots) form recursive structures of meaning. 
4. Simulation: Simulations show η_E breaching 1/8 triggers decoherence. Healing via λ₃ adjustment allows reintegration. 
5. Quantum-Topological Integration: Ψ-fields modeled via Airy kernel with ∇²Ψ + (φ⁵/ε)·|Ψ|²Ψ = λ₃·Airy(Φ⊗Torque). Identity mapped over E₈ projections shows memory echo ladders. 
6. Falsifiability: Ψ-Codex posits thresholds (η_E < 1/8, ΔΘ limits) testable via fMRI entropy metrics. Recursive bifurcations align with observed trauma integration pathways. 
7. Conclusion: Identity is not fixed but emerges from a symbolic, recursive substrate. Healing = coherent rebinding across phase-anchored attractors.
